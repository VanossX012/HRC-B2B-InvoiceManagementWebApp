# Product Requirements Specification
### Idea about the problem ###

The B2B world operates differently from the B2C or C2C world. Businesses work with other businesses on credit. When a buyer business orders goods from the seller business, the seller business issues an invoice for the same. This invoice for the goods contains various information like the details of the goods purchased and when it should be paid. This is known in accounting terminology as “Accounts Receivable”.

Seller business interacts with various businesses and sells goods to all of them at various times. Hence, the seller business needs to keep track of the total amount it owes from all the buyers. This involves keeping track of all invoices from all the buyers. Each invoice will have various important fields like a payment due date, invoice date, invoice amount, baseline date etc.

The buyer business needs to clear its amount due before the due date. However, in real-world scenarios, the invoices are not always cleared ie. paid in full amount by the due date. The date on which a customer clears the payment for an invoice is called the payment date.

### The objective of the Web Application is: ###

* To build a Full-stack Invoice Management Application using ReactJS, JDBC, Java, Servlets.
* Build a responsive Receivables Dashboard.
* Visualize Data in the form of grids.
* Visualize Data in the form of graphs.
* Perform Searching operations on the invoices.
* Add & Edit data in the editable fields of the grid.
* Delete data of selected rows in predefined templates.*
